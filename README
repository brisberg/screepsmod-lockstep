# Lockstep (Screeps Server Mod)
Lockstep will prevents the server from ticking unless a tick is specifically requested. Suitable for unit/integration testing of scripts where you need fine grained control over tick events.

## Installation

In your Screeps Server directory:

```sh
npm install @brisberg/screepsmod-lockstep
```

or

```sh
yarn add @brisberg/screepsmod-lockstep
```

Ensure that Screeps automatically added it to your `mods.json` file.
